		<p style="margin-bottom: 25px">You'll be staying in the Archie M. Griffin Grand Ballroom in the Ohio Union. With over 17,000 square feet of space, it's one of the largest ballrooms in Central Ohio - and a campus favorite (and for all the right reasons). Known for its three beautiful chandeliers, lighting capabilities, and floor-to-ceiling windows, the ballroom is an ideal location for a night of hacking.</p>
